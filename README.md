# Basic_Home_Automation_Arduino

This is a basic Home Automation unit created using Arduino Uno. It basically takes speech commands and perform simple tasks. 
For speech recognition I am using Google Speech recognition API. (For Instructions follow: https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition).

This can be easily extended to for the whole home control system controlled by voice cmmands.
